ABSTRACT
Competency based curriculum is the new education system in Kenya that has very many benefits not only to learners but also to both teachers and parents. Some of this benefits are learners able to make better decision on their career and teachers given freedom to carry through the curriculum when classes are on, focusing on learner potential that is the learner does what he or she can do best and many others. Both teachers, learners and parents are facing challenges on how to carry on with this new education system. Main reason being that teachers and parents are products of the outcome based education (8-4-4) and so they have little knowledge about this new system. Currently the teachers use the new learning materials provided by the government. However, most of they are complaining that they are lacking enough skill to do the teaching. Still parents are not able to give their children full support like helping them with the assignment. This system will help teacher on guidelines on how to teach and provide them with enough materials, it will also help parents on guideline on how to help their children to do the assignment and also the learners with the appropriate materials for learning.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1	Background information
CBC education system is the new education system that was introduced in Kenya during the year 2017. Teachers needs enough skill to capture the learner’s interest before he or she is graduated to the next level. Currently, teachers uses teaching materials provided by the government to train the learner. Sometimes this teaching materials are not enough, also most of the school haven’t yet received the materials, and also teachers has not undergone enough training to teach the learners well. On the other side parents should give support to their children because they don’t know much about the new curriculum. 
Creating a system that will help the teacher with full training, teaching guidelines and teaching material will help solve this problem on the side of teachers. Also helping the parents assist their children to do the assignment and to learn will make this system more effective and productive.
1.2 Problem statement.
Currently, the teachers in the CBC System uses teaching materials such as books provided by the government. Not every school has received all the teaching material and also the most of the teachers have not perfected on teaching due to inadequate training. This pose a problem to the student having less training to proceed to the next level of education in their curriculum.
Most the parents also are not much conversant with the CBC system because most of them went through the 8-4-4 system. Parents also have to attend to school meeting to know the progress of the teacher in terms of the syllabus. This means that parents might face challenges in helping their children to the assignment and any other activity given by the teachers to do at home. 
For the learner to get more materials to do help them do assignment or learn an extra step from the teacher, might be a problem since the teaching and learning materials are not enough. This also will reduce the performance of the learner on becoming the best in his or her field. 
1.3.1	Description of the current system
In the current system teachers use books provided by the government to teach and get guidelines on how to carry out the teaching activity. Teachers also needs to draw worksheets or competency based assessment manually to give the learners as assignment or test. This becomes time consuming and a lot of energy is required to do this task. Teachers has to do worksheets or competency based assessment for more than one class with more than 10 learners.
Parents use their basic knowledge to help their children to do the assignment whenever they don’t understand they live that for the children to do for themselves.
Whenever the learners wants to do further study for themselves they just uses the books provide by the teachers only.
1.3.2 How does the current system work
The teacher uses books to teach the topic of the day and have to mark the page which he or she stops teaching at. Then the teacher gives the assignment to the learners either by writing it down in paper or in the board or even dictate for them to write down. After the learner has been given the assignment he can do it either home or at school during their own time. At this stage the learner might need assistant either from the parent or any other place. After the learner is done with the assignment he or she submits the assignment to the teacher for marking. Then the teacher marks and brings the assignment results in the next lesson. In the lesson the teacher can revise on the assignment to rectify in where the learner went wrong. After the teacher is done revising the assignment he or she continues from where he stopper from in the last lesson. 
1.3.2	Weakness of the current system
After some conducting some few research I have realized that the current system of has these weaknesses:-
•	Parents does not give their children support because they are not much conversant with the new system
•	Both parent and teachers face difficult in knowing how far the learner is in the current grade. 
•	Teachers may not know which of their learner have difficulty in a give area.
•	Teachers uses teaching materials that are not enough to teach the learners to the full expectations.
•	Teachers have inadequate skills to teach the learners.
•	Learners may lack enough material to help them during the assignment or to revise for the exams.

1.4	Proposed Solution
	Every day tracking the progress of a student. This is because teachers or parents face difficulty in keeping tracking of each and every student progress in the current grade.
	Identifying of the fast and slow learners. Since a teacher can have many students it hard for them to identify which learner requires more attention than the other.
	Provision of enough teaching materials for learners. Teachers have insufficient teaching material for the learners to do best in their learning.
	Producing the best candidate. The problem that led to this solution is that there is less materials for learners, parents lack enough support for the learners and teachers lack best platform to teach the learners.
